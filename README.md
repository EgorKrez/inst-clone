# inst-clone 
Instagram-clone was written in Angular, SCSS, TypeScript, HTML5 with using JWT. I've tried to create instagram copy with main instagram featues.

# How to use
## Start server
Run following command: 
`ng serve` 
## Navigate to http://localhost:4200/.
The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
## Enter `admin` for login and password 
## Usage
After login page application redirects you to the posts page. You can add, edit and delete posts. 

# Goals
This isn't release version and application will be improved.
