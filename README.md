# inst-clone 
Instagram-clone was written in Angular, SCSS, TypeScript, HTML5 with using JWT. I've tried to create instagram copy with main instagram featues.

#How to use 
Run ng serve for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
When starting the application we look login field, we must enter "admin" in both fields and application redirects us to posts. We can add new posts, edit and delete some posts 
if we want to do that. This isn't release version and application will be improved.

#Goals
[] - Improve design of this application.
[] - Add infinity scroll to optimize my application.
